## Release Notes

### v1.0.0 - "Foundation"

This is the initial release of FlexKit.Configuration, establishing the foundation for the FlexKit ecosystem. This release focuses on providing a robust, flexible configuration system that bridges the gap between Microsoft's structured IConfiguration and developer-friendly dynamic access patterns.

**Key Highlights:**
- üöÄ **Dynamic Access**: `config.Database.ConnectionString` syntax
- üì¶ **Autofac Ready**: Seamless DI integration with module scanning
- üîß **Type Safe**: Built-in conversion with `config["Port"].ToType<int>()`
- üåç **Multi-Source**: JSON, environment variables, and .env files
- ‚ö° **Modern**: Built for .NET 9 with latest C# features

**Perfect for:**
- New .NET 9 applications requiring flexible configuration
- Legacy application modernization
- Teams wanting dynamic configuration access with type safety
- Applications with complex configuration hierarchies

**Next Steps:**
The FlexKit.Configuration module serves as the foundation for the broader FlexKit ecosystem. Future releases will build upon this configuration system to provide integrated logging, security, data access, and other enterprise application concerns.
