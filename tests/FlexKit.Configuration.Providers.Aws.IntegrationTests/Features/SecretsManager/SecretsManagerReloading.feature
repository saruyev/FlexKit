Feature: Secrets Manager Reloading
As a developer using AWS Secrets Manager with automatic reloading
I want to configure automatic secret refresh from Secrets Manager
So that my application can pick up secret rotations and updates without restart

    @SecretsManager @Reloading
    Scenario: Configure automatic reloading with simple interval
        Given I have established a secrets reload controller environment
        And I have secrets reload controller configuration with automatic reloading from "infrastructure-module-aws-config.json"
        When I configure secrets reload controller by building the configuration
        Then the secrets reload controller configuration should be built successfully
        And the secrets reload controller should be configured for automatic reloading

    @SecretsManager @Reloading @TimeSpan
    Scenario: Configure automatic reloading with specific intervals
        Given I have established a secrets reload controller environment
        And I have secrets reload controller configuration with 30 second reload interval from "infrastructure-module-aws-config.json"
        When I configure secrets reload controller by building the configuration
        Then the secrets reload controller configuration should be built successfully
        And the secrets reload controller should have reload interval of "00:00:30"

    @SecretsManager @Reloading @JSON
    Scenario: Configure automatic reloading with JSON processing
        Given I have established a secrets reload controller environment
        And I have secrets reload controller configuration with JSON processing and reloading from "infrastructure-module-aws-config.json"
        When I configure secrets reload controller by building the configuration
        Then the secrets reload controller configuration should be built successfully
        And the secrets reload controller should process JSON secrets correctly

    @SecretsManager @Reloading @Optional
    Scenario: Configure optional reloading with missing secrets
        Given I have established a secrets reload controller environment
        And I have secrets reload controller configuration with optional reloading from "infrastructure-module-minimal-config.json"
        When I configure secrets reload controller by building the configuration
        Then the secrets reload controller configuration should be built successfully
        And the secrets reload controller should handle missing secrets gracefully

    @SecretsManager @Reloading @ErrorHandling
    Scenario: Handle reloading errors gracefully
        Given I have established a secrets reload controller environment
        And I have secrets reload controller configuration with error tolerant reloading from "infrastructure-module-error-scenarios.json"
        When I configure secrets reload controller by building the configuration
        Then the secrets reload controller configuration should be built successfully
        And the secrets reload controller should handle reload errors gracefully

    @SecretsManager @Reloading @Performance
    Scenario: Configure reloading with performance considerations
        Given I have established a secrets reload controller environment
        And I have secrets reload controller configuration with optimized reloading from "infrastructure-module-aws-config.json"
        When I configure secrets reload controller by building the configuration
        Then the secrets reload controller configuration should be built successfully
        And the secrets reload controller should optimize reload performance

    @SecretsManager @Reloading @FlexConfig
    Scenario: Access reloaded secrets through FlexConfig interface
        Given I have established a secrets reload controller environment
        And I have secrets reload controller configuration with automatic reloading from "infrastructure-module-aws-config.json"
        When I configure secrets reload controller by building the configuration
        And I verify secrets reload controller dynamic access capabilities
        Then the secrets reload controller FlexConfig should provide dynamic access to reloaded configuration

    @SecretsManager @Reloading @Validation
    Scenario: Validate reload timer initialization and disposal
        Given I have established a secrets reload controller environment
        And I have secrets reload controller configuration with timer validation from "infrastructure-module-aws-config.json"
        When I configure secrets reload controller by building the configuration
        Then the secrets reload controller configuration should be built successfully
        And the secrets reload controller timer should be properly initialized
        And the secrets reload controller should support proper disposal
