    @AWS @Performance @Reloading @PerformanceOptimized
    Scenario: Measure automatic reloading performance impact
        Given I have established an aws performance controller environment
        And I have aws performance controller configuration with performance-optimized reloading from "infrastructure-module-performance-config.json"
        When I configure aws performance controller by building the configuration with performance monitoring
        Then the aws performance controller configuration should be built successfully
        And the aws performance controller should demonstrate efficient reloading performance

    @AWS @Performance @DynamicAccess @FlexConfig
    Scenario: Measure FlexConfig dynamic access performance
        Given I have established an aws performance controller environment
