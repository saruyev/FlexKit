Feature: Azure Performance Scenarios
As a developer concerned with application performance
I want to test Azure configuration loading performance characteristics
So that I can optimize configuration access in production

    @Performance @KeyVault @LoadTesting
    Scenario: Test Key Vault loading performance with large secret sets
        Given I have established an azure performance controller environment
        And I have azure performance controller configuration with large Key Vault from "infrastructure-module-azure-config.json"
        When I configure azure performance controller with performance monitoring
        And I configure azure performance controller by building the configuration
        Then the azure performance controller should complete Key Vault loading within performance limits
        And the azure performance controller should demonstrate efficient secret retrieval
        And the azure performance controller should report Key Vault performance metrics

    @Performance @AppConfiguration @LoadTesting
    Scenario: Test App Configuration loading performance with extensive configuration
        Given I have established an azure performance controller environment
        And I have azure performance controller configuration with extensive App Configuration from "infrastructure-module-azure-config.json"
        When I configure azure performance controller with performance monitoring
        And I configure azure performance controller by building the configuration
        Then the azure performance controller should complete App Configuration loading within performance limits
        And the azure performance controller should demonstrate efficient configuration retrieval
        And the azure performance controller should report App Configuration performance metrics

    @Performance @ConcurrentAccess @Threading
    Scenario: Test concurrent access to Azure configuration sources
        Given I have established an azure performance controller environment
        And I have azure performance controller configuration with concurrent access setup from "infrastructure-module-azure-config.json"
        When I configure azure performance controller with concurrent access testing
        And I configure azure performance controller by building the configuration with concurrency
        Then the azure performance controller should handle concurrent access safely
        And the azure performance controller should demonstrate thread-safe configuration access
        And the azure performance controller should report concurrency performance metrics

    @Performance @Memory @ResourceUsage
    Scenario: Monitor memory usage during Azure configuration loading
        Given I have established an azure performance controller environment
        And I have azure performance controller configuration with memory monitoring from "infrastructure-module-azure-config.json"
        When I configure azure performance controller with memory tracking
        And I configure azure performance controller by building the configuration
        Then the azure performance controller should maintain acceptable memory usage
        And the azure performance controller should demonstrate efficient resource utilization
        And the azure performance controller should report memory usage metrics
