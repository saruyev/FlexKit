Feature: Azure Advanced Scenarios
As a developer implementing complex Azure integration patterns
I want to test advanced configuration scenarios and edge cases
So that I can handle sophisticated production requirements

    @Advanced @SecretVersioning @KeyVault
    Scenario: Test Key Vault secret versioning and rollback
        Given I have established an advanced controller environment
        And I have advanced controller configuration with versioned Key Vault from "infrastructure-module-azure-config.json"
        When I configure advanced controller with specific secret versions
        And I configure advanced controller by building the configuration
        Then the advanced controller should access specific secret versions
        And the advanced controller configuration should contain version-specific values
        And the advanced controller should demonstrate version management capabilities

    @Advanced @ConfigurationSnapshots @AppConfiguration
    Scenario: Test App Configuration snapshots and point-in-time recovery
        Given I have established an advanced controller environment
        And I have advanced controller configuration with snapshot App Configuration from "infrastructure-module-azure-config.json"
        When I configure advanced controller with configuration snapshots
        And I configure advanced controller by building the configuration
        Then the advanced controller should support configuration snapshots
        And the advanced controller should demonstrate point-in-time configuration access
        And the advanced controller should handle snapshot-based rollback scenarios

    @Advanced @ABTesting @FeatureFlags
    Scenario: Test A/B testing scenarios with App Configuration feature flags
        Given I have established an advanced controller environment
        And I have advanced controller configuration with A/B testing setup from "infrastructure-module-azure-config.json"
        When I configure advanced controller with A/B testing enabled
        And I configure advanced controller by building the configuration
        Then the advanced controller should support A/B testing scenarios
        And the advanced controller should demonstrate user-based feature flag evaluation
        And the advanced controller should handle percentage-based feature rollouts

    @Advanced @MultiTenant @Isolation
    Scenario: Test multi-tenant configuration isolation with Azure services
        Given I have established an advanced controller environment
        And I have advanced controller configuration with multi-tenant setup from "infrastructure-module-azure-config.json"
        When I configure advanced controller with tenant isolation
        And I configure advanced controller by building the configuration
        Then the advanced controller should support tenant-specific configuration
        And the advanced controller should demonstrate proper tenant isolation
        And the advanced controller should handle cross-tenant access prevention

    @Advanced @CrossRegion @Failover
    Scenario: Test cross-region failover scenarios with Azure services
        Given I have established an advanced controller environment
        And I have advanced controller configuration with cross-region setup from "infrastructure-module-azure-config.json"
        When I configure advanced controller with regional failover
        And I configure advanced controller by building the configuration with failover testing
        Then the advanced controller should support cross-region failover
        And the advanced controller should demonstrate regional redundancy
        And the advanced controller should handle region-specific configuration differences

    @Advanced @LargeDataSets @Optimization
    Scenario: Test handling of large configuration data sets with optimization
        Given I have established an advanced controller environment
        And I have advanced controller configuration with large data sets from "infrastructure-module-azure-config.json"
        When I configure advanced controller with optimization strategies
        And I configure advanced controller by building the configuration
        Then the advanced controller should handle large data sets efficiently
        And the advanced controller should demonstrate optimization techniques
        And the advanced controller should maintain performance with extensive configuration

    @Advanced @ImportExport @ConfigurationManagement
    Scenario: Test configuration import/export scenarios with Azure services
        Given I have established an advanced controller environment
        And I have advanced controller configuration with import/export capabilities from "infrastructure-module-azure-config.json"
        When I configure advanced controller with import/export testing
        And I configure advanced controller by building the configuration
        Then the advanced controller should support configuration export
        And the advanced controller should demonstrate configuration import capabilities
        And the advanced controller should handle configuration migration scenarios
