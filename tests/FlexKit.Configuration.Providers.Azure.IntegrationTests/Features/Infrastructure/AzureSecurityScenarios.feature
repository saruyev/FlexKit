Feature: Azure Security Scenarios
As a developer implementing secure Azure configuration
I want to test various authentication and authorization scenarios
So that I can ensure proper security handling in production

    @Security @Authentication @KeyVault
    Scenario: Test Key Vault access with managed identity simulation
        Given I have established a security controller environment
        And I have security controller configuration with managed identity Key Vault from "infrastructure-module-azure-config.json"
        When I configure security controller with managed identity authentication
        And I configure security controller by building the configuration
        Then the security controller should authenticate successfully with managed identity
        And the security controller configuration should contain secure secrets
        And the security controller should demonstrate proper credential handling

    @Security @Authentication @AppConfiguration
    Scenario: Test App Configuration access with service principal simulation
        Given I have established a security controller environment
        And I have security controller configuration with service principal App Configuration from "infrastructure-module-azure-config.json"
        When I configure security controller with service principal authentication
        And I configure security controller by building the configuration
        Then the security controller should authenticate successfully with service principal
        And the security controller configuration should contain configuration data
        And the security controller should demonstrate proper credential management

    @Security @RBAC @Authorization
    Scenario: Test RBAC permission variations with Azure services
        Given I have established a security controller environment
        And I have security controller configuration with limited permissions from "infrastructure-module-azure-config.json"
        When I configure security controller with restricted RBAC permissions
        And I configure security controller by building the configuration
        Then the security controller should handle limited permissions gracefully
        And the security controller should demonstrate partial access scenarios
        And the security controller should report authorization issues appropriately

    @Security @AccessDenied @ErrorHandling
    Scenario: Handle access denied scenarios gracefully
        Given I have established a security controller environment
        And I have security controller configuration with denied access from "infrastructure-module-azure-config.json"
        When I configure security controller with access denied simulation
        And I configure security controller with error tolerance by building the configuration
        Then the security controller should handle access denied gracefully
        And the security controller should demonstrate proper error reporting
        And the security controller should maintain application stability
