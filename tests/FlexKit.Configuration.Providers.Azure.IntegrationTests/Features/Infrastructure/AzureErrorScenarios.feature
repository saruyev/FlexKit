Feature: Azure Error Scenarios
As a developer building resilient applications
I want to test various error conditions with Azure configuration sources
So that I can handle failures gracefully in production

    @ErrorHandling @NetworkFailures @KeyVault
    Scenario: Handle Key Vault network failures gracefully
        Given I have established an error handling controller environment
        And I have error handling controller configuration with Key Vault from "infrastructure-module-azure-config.json"
        When I configure error handling controller with network failure simulation
        And I configure error handling controller by building the configuration with error tolerance
        Then the error handling controller should handle network failures gracefully
        And the error handling controller should demonstrate fallback behavior
        And the error handling controller should report network error details

    @ErrorHandling @InvalidConfiguration @AppConfiguration
    Scenario: Handle invalid App Configuration connection strings
        Given I have established an error handling controller environment
        And I have error handling controller configuration with invalid App Configuration from "infrastructure-module-azure-config.json"
        When I configure error handling controller with invalid connection string
        And I configure error handling controller by building the configuration with error tolerance
        Then the error handling controller should handle invalid configuration gracefully
        And the error handling controller should demonstrate error reporting
        And the error handling controller should maintain application stability

    @ErrorHandling @MissingSecrets @KeyVault
    Scenario: Handle missing secrets in Key Vault
        Given I have established an error handling controller environment
        And I have error handling controller configuration with missing secrets Key Vault from "infrastructure-module-azure-config.json"
        When I configure error handling controller with missing secret references
        And I configure error handling controller by building the configuration with error tolerance
        Then the error handling controller should handle missing secrets gracefully
        And the error handling controller should provide meaningful error messages
        And the error handling controller should allow partial configuration loading

    @ErrorHandling @CredentialFailures @Authentication
    Scenario: Handle authentication credential failures
        Given I have established an error handling controller environment
        And I have error handling controller configuration with invalid credentials from "infrastructure-module-azure-config.json"
        When I configure error handling controller with credential failure simulation
        And I configure error handling controller by building the configuration with error tolerance
        Then the error handling controller should handle credential failures gracefully
        And the error handling controller should demonstrate authentication error handling
        And the error handling controller should provide security-safe error messages

    @ErrorHandling @RateLimiting @Throttling
    Scenario: Handle Azure service rate limiting and throttling
        Given I have established an error handling controller environment
        And I have error handling controller configuration with rate limiting simulation from "infrastructure-module-azure-config.json"
        When I configure error handling controller with throttling simulation
        And I configure error handling controller by building the configuration with retry logic
        Then the error handling controller should handle rate limiting gracefully
        And the error handling controller should demonstrate retry mechanisms
        And the error handling controller should report throttling encounters
