| **Background Queue** | 179.35 ns | 4 B | 0 |
| **Sustained Pattern** | 23.56 μs | 8,272 B | Controlled |

**Key Benefits**:
- Zero allocation for log entry creation
- Controlled memory usage during high-frequency operations
- Minimal garbage collection pressure

### 4. Background Queue Performance

The background logging system delivers exceptional throughput:

| Operation | Latency | Allocation |
|-----------|---------|------------|
| **Single Enqueue** | 42.10 ns | 1 B |
| **100 Operations** | 3.94 μs | 60 B |
| **1000 Operations** | 42.86 μs | 595 B |

**Scalability**: Linear performance scaling with excellent memory efficiency even at high throughput.

### 5. Interception Overhead Analysis

Comparison of different logging approaches:

| Method | Execution Time | Memory | Performance vs Baseline |
|--------|----------------|---------|-------------------------|
| **Native (No Framework)** | 2.47 μs | 1,271 B | Baseline |
| **Manual IFlexKitLogger** | 2.42 μs | 916 B | **2% faster, 28% less memory** |
| **NoLog Attribute** | 1.08 μs | 888 B | **56% faster, 30% less memory** |
| **LogInput Attribute** | 2.67 μs | 1,279 B | 8% slower |
| **LogBoth Attribute** | 2.44 μs | 1,273 B | Equivalent |
| **Auto Detection** | 2.57 μs | 1,273 B | 4% slower |

**Optimization Insight**: The `NoLog` attribute provides significant performance benefits when logging is not needed, while active logging scenarios perform equivalently to or better than baseline.

### 6. High-Frequency Operation Performance

Performance under sustained load (1000-10000 iterations):

| Scenario | 1K Iterations | 10K Iterations | Memory Efficiency |
|----------|---------------|----------------|-------------------|
| **Native MEL** | 2.54 ms | 25.50 ms | Baseline |
| **NoLog (FlexKit)** | 1.40 ms | 13.94 ms | **45% faster, 29% less memory** |
| **LogInput** | 2.69 ms | 26.04 ms | Equivalent performance |
| **LogBoth** | 2.59 ms | 25.15 ms | Equivalent performance |

**Sustained Performance**: FlexKit maintains consistent performance advantages even under high-frequency operations.

### 7. Configuration and Caching Performance

Decision caching system optimization:
